**Gender Prediction Model using Decision Tree, KNN, and Logistic Regression**



This project predicts gender based on physical attributes using multiple machine learning algorithms: Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression.



* Objective

Classify gender (male/female) based on features like height, weight, etc., by comparing different ML models.
