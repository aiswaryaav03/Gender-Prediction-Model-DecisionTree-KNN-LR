**Gender Prediction Model using Decision Tree, KNN, and Logistic Regression**

This project predicts gender based on physical attributes using multiple machine learning algorithms: Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression.

* Objective
Classify gender (male/female) based on features like long hair,forehead width,forehead length,nose length etc., by comparing different ML models.
